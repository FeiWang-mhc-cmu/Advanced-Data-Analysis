Project 1: 
"Analyzing and Modeling Canvasback PopulationsAnalyzing and Modeling Canvasback Populations"

•	Assessed the prediction model of Canvasback population (an endangered yet popular waterfowl species among hunters), studied the effects of regulatory policy on population decline, and observed a time lag between model prediction and actual population
•	Coded independently an interactive user application using the Shiny web framework to help visualize population change and impacts of hunting regulation policy over time for the benefits of the public
