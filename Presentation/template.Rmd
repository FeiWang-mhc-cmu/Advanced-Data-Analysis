# Introduction

## A set of talking points

- Cite the section you are discussing
- Provide a full statement of the problem

## A different set of talking points

- Think of ways to engage students with a `clicker` question
- Provide a motivating example

# Statement of the problem

Pepys was trying to determine the probabilities of seeing at least $m$ sixes when $6m$ six-sided dice were tossed.  What happens to this probability as $m$ gets larger?

SOLUTION: We know that when $m$=1, P(at least one six) = 1-P(no sixes) = $1 - (5/6)^6$ = 0.665102 and that from class, we know that the probability decreases for $m=2$ and $m=3$.  Is there a limiting behavior?


# Simulation

```{r, fig.keep='last', echo=FALSE}
# note special chunk option!
m <- 1:100   # try changing this to 1:2500
proba <- 1 - pbinom(m-1, size=6*m, prob=1/6)
xyplot(proba ~ m, type=c("p", "l"), 
       ylim=c(0.49, max(proba)), # make sure we see the line at 0.50
       xlab="threshold for number of sixes", 
       ylab="probability of seeing at least that many")
ladd(panel.abline(h=0.50))  # add the line at 0.50
```
