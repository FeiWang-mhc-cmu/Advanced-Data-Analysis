Does this information give me an estimate of the potential postoperative mortality?\"\n\n# Rule of Thumb\n\nGiven no observed events in n trials, a 95% upper bound on the rate of occurence is 3/n.\n\n# Answer to the scenario\n\n- Given no observed events in 20 trials, a 95% upper bound on the rate of occurence is 3/20=0.15.\n- Even though there is no fatalities in the past 20 operations, the rate is still as high as 15%.\n\n# Basis of the Rule\n\n- Assume the event Y is a Poisson (a) with n samples. \n- (Pop Quiz: Why Poisson? Hint: Amanda's presentation on Poisson)\n- Sum of indept Possion variables is also Poisson -> Poisson (na)\n- Pr(At least one Yi is not zero) = Pr(Sum of Yi is greater than 0)\n- Pr(sum of Yi equals to 0) = exp(-na) = 0.05\n- Solve for a \n\n# Assessment \n\nThe concentration of a microorganism in a water source is 1% per liter. How many liters must I take to be 95% sure that I have at least one organism?\n\n# Answer\n- 3/0.01=300 L\n\n# Closing thoughts\n\n- No observed events, n trials, 95% upper bound -> 3/n\n- Can solve for n as well, i.e. n=3/a\n\n",
